                Grab a freeze power-up to keep Eggy in place for a few seconds, helping you maintain control. The key to Eggy Car is finding the right balance: go fast enough to climb steep hills without knocking the egg off. While mastering this balance can be tricky at first, you'll improve with practice.

                As you collect coins and unlock various cars, you'll notice that each has unique advantages. You might prefer a sleek car for speed, but it may struggle to hold the egg in place. Conversely, a bulky truck may offer safety at the cost of speed. Experiment with different styles to find what works best for you.
